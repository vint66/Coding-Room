# Collaboration space for Coding Room group.

The idea of this group is to have people to discuss and brainstorm different coding and automation related things.
Group meant to have different level of experience and language-agnostic members.

This is not trainings but dialogs. However we can share knowledge here as well.
Even though group is not about DevNet this topic still could be covered, so feel free to brought up any questions/issues.


As an example few options we can do:
- Pick 1-2 task from leetcode and discuss possible solutionS and pros and cons of it.
- Do some live small coding (let say retrieve config via netconf with python)
- Or more basic (work with data structures or algorithms)
- Any projects/work you do need help or second look or looking for ideas.
- DevNet demo/other stuff.

Feel free to add any tasks or solutions in there.
Open discussions about anything.
